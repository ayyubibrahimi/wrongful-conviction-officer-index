# Wrongful Conviction Officer Index: Extended Data Collection

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to processing and analyzing new data collected on officers identified in the Wrongful Conviction Officer Index who have been linked to misconduct allegations. Our goal is to extract structured information from this new data, building upon our previous research to provide a more comprehensive understanding of officers involved in wrongful convictions and their history of misconduct.

## Background and Context

### Past Research

To contextualize this project, it's important to understand our previous work:

1. [Statewide Database of Police Misconduct in Louisiana](https://github.com/ipno-llead/processing): Created a comprehensive database of police misconduct in Louisiana.

2. [Wrongful Conviction Officer Index](https://github.com/ipno-llead/US-IPNO-exonerations): Extracted names of law enforcement officers from archived wrongful conviction case files using LLMs.

3. [Dataset Linking Repository](https://github.com/ayyubibrahimi/wrongful-convictions-entity-res): Linked the above two datasets to identify officers named in wrongful convictions who also had records of misconduct.

### Key Findings

By linking these datasets, we discovered valuable connections. For example:

**Case Study: Officer Keith Joseph**

- **Wrongful Conviction Index:**
  - Named in four archived case files:
    - Two depositions
    - Two police reports
- **Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database:**
  - Lieutenant, Badge Number 3659
  - 12 allegations of misconduct
    - Listed on allegations with three officers named in IPNO's internal case management system
  - Department: Field Operations Bureau, Sixth District, Platoon C
  - Demographics: 52, Black, Male
  - Tenure: 1988 - Present

## Current Project Scope

This repository focuses on:

1. Collecting additional data on officers identified in the Wrongful Conviction Officer Index who have been linked to misconduct allegations.
2. Processing and structuring this new data to extract meaningful information.
3. Analyzing the extended dataset to gain deeper insights into the patterns and characteristics of officers involved in wrongful convictions and misconduct.
